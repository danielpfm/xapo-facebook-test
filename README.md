### Requirements

  - The main idea of the project is to list projects owned by Facebook on Github.
  - Try to code as clean and clear as possible, taking into account reusability and legibility is more important than high performance. 
  - Having a great and polished design is not the goal of this project.
  - The app must have a sidebar navigation with Facebook projects sorted by watchers. 
  - Clicking on one of them should fetch that project data and populate the main view with its details. 
  - Those details must include a list of project contributors.

### Extra Features!

  - Stats about the repos
  - Search input for the repos list
